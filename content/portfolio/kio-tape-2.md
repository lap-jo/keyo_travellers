Murchison Falls National Park is one of Uganda's premier wildlife destinations,
home to an incredible diversity of flora and fauna. With Keyo Tours and Travels,
you can experience the raw power and natural splendor of this awe-inspiring park
on an unforgettable 3-day, 2-night guided tour.

Your adventure begins with a scenic drive from Kampala to the northern reaches
of Murchison Falls National Park. Along the way, keep your eyes peeled for 
elephants, giraffes, antelope and other plains game. Upon arrival, you'll settle
into your comfortable accommodation overlooking the sweeping Nile River valley.

The next day, you'll embark on a thrilling boat cruise along the Nile, navigating
past hippos, crocodiles and a tremendous variety of birds before arriving at the
base of the majestic Murchison Falls. Here, you'll disembark and hike to the top
of the falls, witnessing the Nile squeeze through a 7-meter gap and plunge 43
meters down in a thunderous display of raw power.

In the afternoon, you'll head out on a game drive through the park's diverse 
ecosystems, tracking lions, leopards, buffalo, giraffe and other wildlife in 
their natural habitats. Your expert guide will share fascinating insights about
the park's ecology and conservation efforts.

On your final day, you have the option to visit the top of the falls again for a different vantage point, or explore the northern section of the park in search of the rare white rhino. Before reluctantly departing, you'll have time to reflect on the incredible sights and sounds of this natural wonder.

Priced at just $550 per person, our Murchison Falls tour package includes round-trip transportation from Kampala, all park fees, boat cruise, accommodations, meals and the services of a professional guide. Contact Keyo Tours and Travels today to book your unforgettable Ugandan safari adventure!
